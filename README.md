## [Micro-optimizations in C++ üöÄ](https://github.com/Jumbub/game-of-life-cpp)

I love diving deep into C++ code and finding ways to squeeze out every ounce of performance. This project highlights:

- **Branchless Logic**: Improving CPU performance through better instruction-level parallelism, reduced branch mispredictions and optimized pipeline utilization.
- **CPU Caching**: Optimizing memory access patterns to leverage the CPU cache hierarchy effectively.
- **Compiler Benchmarks**: Exploring performance differences across various compilers and tweaking code accordingly.
- **Job Pooling**: Implementing efficient job pooling techniques for parallel and asynchronous programming.

## [More micro-optimizations in C++ üèéÔ∏è](https://github.com/Jumbub/bf-cpp)

It's entirely possible this is the fast non-jit brainfuck interpreter (on my machine), notably it required knowledge in:

- **Instruction Speed vs Data Locality**: Prioritised data types based on their operation clock counts.
- **Computed Gotos**: Replaced traditional dispatch logic with a system more friendly with branch prediction.
- **Instruction Locality Awareness**: Explored how source file order, dead code, and struct layout can influence performance through cache behavior and code locality.

## [Maximizing Web Performance ‚ö°Ô∏è](https://github.com/Jumbub/game-of-life-js)

JavaScript is faster than people expect, in this project I highlight techniques for optimizing it for speed and efficiency:

- **Multi-threading**: Leveraging web workers and atomics for concurrent execution.
- **Typed Arrays**: Utilizing typed arrays to reduce memory overhead through and encourage aggressive optimisations in V8.
- **C++ Performance Comparisons**: Conducting performance benchmarks between JavaScript and C++ for optimization insights.
- **Game of Life**: Check out the app built with these techniques [here](https://gameoflife.jamiebray.me/)!

## [Personal Site üåê](https://github.com/Jumbub/jamiebray-ui)

Sometimes, less is more! I've written my personal site with zero JS to illustrate the power and flexibility of CSS.

- **Semantic HTML**: Naturally increasing accessibility and reducing DOM bloat by properly leveraging HTML semantics.
- **Native SPA**: Effectively leveraging browser targets to create native single page app experiences.
- **Raw CSS**: Exploring the limits of native CSS capabilities.

## [Self-replicating Minecraft Robot ü§ñ](https://github.com/Jumbub/replicating-robots)

This Minecraft mod is what ignited my passion for programming *all* the way back in 2012.

I remember finding this challenge in the forums and being in awe at the knowledge required... So in this repository I go back and complete the challenge. Feels good üòå

- **The Challenge**: Write an AI in Lua capable of replicating itself.
- **Capabilties**: The robot forages, mines, smelts and crafts all while operating efficiently to minimise fuel usage.

## [Logic Solver üéØ](https://github.com/Jumbub/block-world)

Logical programming is interesting because the solutions almost write themselves, this is my first foray into the topic:

- **Backward Chaining**: Implementing backward chaining algorithms for logical reasoning.
- **Pretty Diagrams**: Visualizing logical structures and solutions with beautiful and educational diagrams.
- **Blockworld**: Check out my logic solver in action [here](https://blockworld.jamiebray.me/)!

## [Calculator without Floating Point Inaccuracies or Implicit Approximations üßÆ](https://github.com/Jumbub/do-math-right)

Solving expressions without floating point innaccuracies or implicit approximations:

- **Error Bounds Tracking**: Implementing error tracking mechanisms to ensure accuracy when using transcendental functions such as sine.
- **Infinitely Large Fractions**: Storing and operating on numbers in a lossless manor with infinitely large values.
- **Pure Functional Haskell**: Building a calculator using pure functional programming paradigms.

## [Live Drawing with Custom Software & Hardware üé®](https://github.com/Jumbub/pico-to-pico)

A gift to my sister as I headed off to live overseas in Vancuover for a couple years. The idea was that while we were both on opposite sides of the country, we'd still have some level of live casual interaction.

- **Pico W**: Developed firmware for the Raspbery Pico Wifi microcontroller board.
- **MQTT Messaging**: Leveraged the MQTT messaging protocol for real-time communication between devices.
- **Touch Screen Panel**: Integrating touch screen panels for interactive drawing experiences.
- **3D Printing**: Printing and shaping a case to fit the board and touch panel.

## [Abusing TypeScript üí•](https://github.com/Jumbub/abusing-typescript)

TypeScript's type system is truly fascinating. In this repository I explore some of it's limits *and lack thereof*:

- **Turing Complete Type Systems**: Exploring the expressive power of TypeScript's type system.
- **Type-Driven Development**: Leveraging types for program design and verification.
