# Hi there! üëã

I'm Jamie Bray, a software engineer with a passion for optimizing code and building cool projects. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

## [Maximizing Web Performance ‚ö°Ô∏è](https://github.com/Jumbub/game-of-life-js)

JavaScript is faster than people expect, in this project I highlight techniques for optimizing it for speed and efficiency:

- **Multi-threading**: Leveraging web workers and atomics for concurrent execution.
- **Typed Arrays**: Utilizing typed arrays to improve code predictability and reduce memory overhead.
- **C++ Performance Comparisons**: Conducting performance benchmarks between JavaScript and C++ for optimization insights.
- **Game of Life**: Check out the app built with these techniques [here](https://gameoflife.jamiebray.me/)!

## [Micro-optimizations in C++ üöÄ](https://github.com/Jumbub/game-of-life-cpp)

I love diving deep into C++ code and finding ways to squeeze out every ounce of performance. This project highlights:

- **Branchless Logic**: Improving CPU performance through better instruction-level parallelism, reduced branch mispredictions and optimized pipeline utilization.
- **CPU Caching**: Optimizing memory access patterns to leverage the CPU cache hierarchy effectively.
- **Compiler Benchmarks**: Exploring performance differences across various compilers and tweaking code accordingly.
- **Job Pooling**: Implementing efficient job pooling techniques for parallel and asynchronous programming.

## [JavaScriptless Personal Site üåê](https://github.com/Jumbub/jamiebray-ui)

Sometimes, less is more! I've created my personal website with a focus on frameworkless native HTML5 practices.

## [Live Drawing App with Contained Hardware & Firmware üé®](https://github.com/Jumbub/pico-to-pico)

I have experience building a live drawing application that integrates hardware and firmware components. Some highlights:

- **Pico W**: Developed firmware for the Raspbery Pico Wifi microcontroller board.
- **MQTT Messaging**: Leveraged the MQTT messaging protocol for real-time communication between devices.
- **Touch Screen Panel**: Integrating touch screen panels for interactive drawing experiences.
- **3D Printing**: Printing and shaping a case to fit the board and touch panel.

Logic solving is both challenging and fascinating. Here's a logic solver project I've worked on:

- **Backward Chaining**: Implementing backward chaining algorithms for logical reasoning.
- **Pretty Diagrams**: Visualizing logical structures and solutions with beautiful diagrams.
- **Blockworld**: Check out my logic solver in action [here](https://blockworld.jamiebray.me/)!

## Calculator without Floating Point Inaccuracies or Implicit Approximations üßÆ

Functional programming in Haskell allows for precise calculations without floating point inaccuracies. My calculator project includes:

- **Pure Functional Haskell**: Building a calculator using pure functional programming paradigms.
- **Fractional Numbers**: Handling fractional numbers accurately and with high precision.
- **Error Bounds Tracking**: Implementing error tracking mechanisms to ensure accuracy and precision.

## Self-playing Minecraft Robot ü§ñ

Who doesn't love Minecraft? I've created a Lua-based robot that explores, mines, smelts, and crafts automatically. Key features:

- **Lua Scripting**: Developing scripts in Lua to control the Minecraft robot's actions.
- **Nostalgia**: Combining nostalgia for Minecraft with the joy of automation.
- **Foraging and Crafting**: The robot autonomously forages resources and crafts items in the game.

## Abusing TypeScript üí•

TypeScript's type system can be pushed to its limits. I enjoy exploring the boundaries and discovering creative uses:

- **Turing Complete Type Systems**: Exploring the expressive power of TypeScript's type system.
- **Type-Driven Development**: Leveraging types for program design and verification.
